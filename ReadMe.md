# Parcel v2 Demo

A quick and dirty demo space using latest Parcel's v2 alpha. This is to pull in, track progress on the alpha/beta, and test it out with various projects. Ultimately, it will be a proving ground for [parcel-plugin-goodie-bag](https://github.com/edm00se/parcel-plugin-goodie-bag), which due to naming conventions will forever be only for parcel v1 but will aid its testing in the next, v2 compatible, version of things.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

- `npm run dev` - runs parcel development server, pointing at `index.html`
- `npm run build` - generates build to `/`
